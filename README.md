Challenge: DOM Manipulation

Create an application that uses purely Javascript to change items on your page.

Use 10 different buttons to change 10 different things on the HTML side

Peer Name: Bowen Henry
Peer Review: Great job Ian! All of your buttons work and do the correct task. I like the creativity too. Instead of using a bunch of breaks I would just use the height and width in css to make more room.
